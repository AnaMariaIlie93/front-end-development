      <h2>Works</h2>
      <p>
         His life was highly influenced by church and folk songs, and he used these two types of music as inspiration for his work. His most famous pieces are the fifteen Rukoveti (Potpourri; literally: &quot;handfuls&quot; or &quot;bunches&quot;) - a collection of songs and music 
         (orchestral suites)
         based on motives of Serbian folk music from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia Proper, Montenegro, Kosovo and Metohija, Macedonia and Bulgaria. His other prominent folk-based works include Primorski napjevi 
         (Coastland tunes), and Kozar.

         A significant number of his works were made for church services. Such as the Božanstvena Liturgija Svetog Jovana Zlatoustog 
         (The Divine Liturgy of St. Chrysostom), from which the <strong>Heruvimska pesma</strong> 
         (Cherubic hymn) is most famous. Another two famous religious pieces are <b>Tebe Boga hvalim (Te Deum)</b> and <b>Veličanije Sv</b>. Savi (Megalynarion to St. Sava).
